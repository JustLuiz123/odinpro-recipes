                <li>8 (6 ounce) chicken cutlets</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>16 large fresh sage leaves</li>

                <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
                <li>½ stick butter</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Directions:</h4>

            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>If cutlets are thick, lay them between 2 sheets of wax paper and pound to 1/2-inch thickness with flat side of a meat mallet or bottom of a small, heavy skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put 2 large (or 5 small) sage leaves on top of each cutlet, then wrap 2 slices of prosciutto crosswise around each cutlet, holding sage in place.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 4 cutlets and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and remaining 4 cutlets.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Add wine to skillet and simmer, scraping up any browned bits, 1 minute. Add broth and simmer until slightly reduced, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat; add butter and swirl skillet until butter has melted and sauce is creamy. Spoon 2 tablespoons sauce over each cutlet and serve.</p>
