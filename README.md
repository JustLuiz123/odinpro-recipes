# odin-recipes

This project is going to be me following through the ProjectOdin.

Here I am going to write a series of cooking recipes webpages.

My goal is to keep track of my personal growth as a developer and in order to do that I need to keep updating this repository increasing the complexity/details that I learn along the way.

Thank you for your reading! ðŸ˜Š
